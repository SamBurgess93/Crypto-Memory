## UX 
### Project Goals
The primary goal of RECALL is to provide a web-based interactive game, that is fun and intuitive, through a pattern memory game, designed to test the users ability to recall information thats shown to them.
 
This is my second Milestone Project that must be developed as part of my Full Stack software development course with Code Institute.

The main requirements were to design, develop and implement a dynamic front-end web application using **HTML5**, **CSS3** and **JavaScript**.
