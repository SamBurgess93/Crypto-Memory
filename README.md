## UX 
### Project Goals
The primary goal of RECALL is to provide a web-based interactive game, that is fun and intuitive, through a pattern memory game, designed to test the users ability to recall information thats shown to them.
 
This is my second Milestone Project that must be developed as part of my Full Stack software development course with Code Institute.

The main requirements were to design, develop and implement a dynamic front-end web application using **HTML5**, **CSS3** and **JavaScript**.

#### Player Goals
The player is looking for:
- An enjoyable and entertaining game to play, with clear instructions.
- High Score system that promotes the user to return to the game. 
- An intuitive and vibrant interface. 
- Visual and audio stimulation during play time.

#### Developer / Site Owner Goals
The Developer is looking to:
- Create a fun and entertaining game they would play themselves and share with their friends and family.
- Demonstrate their expertise using multiple software development skills, implementing newly learned languages with libraries and API's to create the finished product.
- Deploy a project they are proud and excited to have on their portfolio.

### User Stories
**As a player, I want to:**


1. Have the ability to create my own username, to personalise the experience.
2. Make the process of starting the game intuitive. 
3. To be able track my progress during the game, with a clear score counter.
4. Clearly know when my answers are correct/incorrect through visual and auditory feedback.
5. Have the ability to toggle sound effects on or off.
6. View the highest score for my session, using a high score counter.
7. Have control on what happens on the end each game, to either play again or end the session.
8. Connect with the developer on a social platform of my choosing to see their other projects.
9. Have the ability to communicate with the developer to provide feedback on the overall experience, to improve the game.
10. Have the option to play the game on any device, whether it be desktop, tablet or mobile phone.


### Development Planes

In order to design and create a web-based interactive game, the developer distinguished the required functionality of the site and how it would answer the user stories, as described above, using the **Five Development Planes**:

<strong>1. <u>Strategy</u></strong>

Broken into three categories, the website will focus on the following target audiences:
- **Roles:**
     - New Players
     - Current Players
     - Returning Players

- **Demographic:**
     - Puzzle game Lovers
     - Aged 10 years and up

- **Psychographics:**
     - Personality & Attitudes:
          - Fun-driven
          - Good memory
          - Competitive
    

The website needs to enable the **user** to:
- Play with ease, interacting without complications
- Control sound settings
- See Current and High Scores
- Get access to instructions if needed
- Provide suggestions and feedback to the developer
- Connect with developer through social links

The website needs to enable the **client** to:
- Enjoy playing their own game
- Allow for user feedback and suggestions
- Communicate with users on social links

<strong>2. <u>Scope</u></strong>

The scope was created from using the Strategy previously defined. This allowed us to align the features to deliver on the strategy. This was seperated into two categories:
- **Content Requirements**
     - The player will be looking for:
          - Dynamic and inviting visuals
          - Simple and vibrant content
          - Current and High scores
          - Creator information 

- **Functionality Requirements**
     - The user will be able to:
          - Play with ease
          - Access Current and High Scores
          - Reach out to the developer
               - Suggestions
               - Social links
